# Chapter 1: Clean Code

“Honesty in small things is not a small thing.”

"Because small things matter."
                
"...spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival."
                
"Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."
                
"Reduced duplication, high expressiveness, and early building of simple abstractions. That’s what makes clean code for me."
                
"No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions. Everything is there."
