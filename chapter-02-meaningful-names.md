# Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

**Class Names**

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage, Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.
                
**Method Names** 

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, deletePage, or save. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with get, set, and is according to the javabean standard.
                
**Pick One Word per Concept** 

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, itâ€™s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes.
                
Avoid using the same word for two purposes.
                
Use Solution Domain Names
                
Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course.
                
Use Problem Domain Names
